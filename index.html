													<h3><strong>Flat Spot</strong></h3>
													<p>This casual motorsport management game was the centerpiece of my Bachelor's Thesis in Game Engineering, and was <strong>developed solo</strong> in <strong>Unity 3D</strong>. The biggest emphasis layed on the <strong>AI programming</strong>, making strong use of concepts like <strong>Finite State Machines</strong> and <strong>Utility Based AI</strong>. However, I also did the <strong>Gameplay programming</strong>, 3D modelling and <strong>shader programming</strong> (using Unity Shader Graph), as well as the <strong>implementation of sound effects using Wwise</strong>.<br><br>
													I wanted the players to experience motorsport like never before: very simple. In this <strong>exiting, fast-paced</strong> management game you can be team principal of your own team, upgrade your car with newly built parts and train your drivers to compete in races and win the championship. Use your drivers <strong>Special Abilities</strong> to gain an advantage over other drivers on track and leave them in the dust.<br><br>

													<h3><strong>WebGPU with C++ - Private Project</strong></h3>
													<p>This scenery was programmed using the graphics API <strong>WebGPU</strong> and the compiler toolchain <strong>emscripten</strong> to deepen my knowledge of 3D graphics.<br><br>
													Through University courses I gained a foothold in 3D graphics programming using <strong>OpenGL</strong>, and in this ongoing project I use the gained expertise to implement various techniques, like Blinn-Phong shading among others. I followed the brilliant tutorial series of <a href="https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/introduction.html"  target="_blank">Elié Michel</a>.</p>

													<h3><strong>A Song of Mold and Cheese</strong></h3>
													<p>A Song of Mold and Cheese is a demo for an <strong>adventure game</strong> that builds a world inside a fridge full of sentient food, where the player can explore the unjsut nature of the food pyramid. In this project, I served as the <strong>Technical Artist</strong>, aiding the Artists in creating and implementing optimized and visually appealing assets. As a <strong>Programmer</strong>, I developed gameplay mechanics and systems to ensure a seamless player experience. Additionally, I implemented the immersive soundscapes of our Sound Artist using <strong>Wwise</strong> to enhance the game's audio atmosphere.<br><br>
													This game was developed with a team of 9 members in the course "Game World Design" at the IT University in Copenhagen. We took inspiration for this project from games like <i>Toem</i>, <i>Bug Snax</i> and <i>It Takes Two</i>. One key takeaway was <strong> how to navigate the creative process</strong> of making a game of this scale with a bigger team than I was used to up until that point. </p>

													<h3><strong>For God and Motherland</strong></h3>
													<p>This game was developed under the aspect of <strong>critical design</strong> in the university course "Playable Media" at the IT University in Copenhagen. As far as technical implementation, this is simple gameloop with no ending condition. It was developed in <strong>Unity 3D</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. For the art I used <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>.<br><br>
													Inspiration for this project were movies like <i>1917</i> or the newest adaptation of the german novel <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> (dt. <i>Im Westen nichts Neues</i>). With this story I want to highlight the stupidity and futility of the concept of war, where the soldiers are merely puppets under the control of power-hungry and ego-driven men. Every soldier you kill has their own backstory, and every life lost is one to many.</p>

													<h3><strong>Brushwood Residence</strong></h3>
													<p>Brushwood Residence is a <strong>mysterious puzzle game</strong> that combines escape room elements with a magical atmosphere. As an adventurer, you explore a house rumored to have <strong>other-worldly paintings</strong> - and the secret to how they capture different realities on their canvases. To find the final answer, you enter the	paintings, solve puzzles, and see how your actions not only affect the paintings but also your reality.<br><br>
													As the designated <strong>Tech Lead</strong> I was responsible to provide guidance for our programmers and oversee the tech side of the project. The project taught me the value of <strong>constant communication</strong> between the departements of a game project, as well as educated me about problems that may arise during a process and how to deal with them.</p>

													<h3><strong>Evil Sandman</strong></h3>
													<p>This Game Jam project was pieced together by a <strong>Team of 6 in 48 hours</strong>. Armed with a dreamcatcher, you embark on a mission to defeat enemies and the evil Sandman in a fever dream world. I programmed the <strong>character controller</strong> and the <strong>Enemy AI using Finite State Machines</strong>, and helped with character rigging and animation.</p>

													<h3><strong>Eternity's Lair</strong></h3>
													<p>This 2.5D Rogue-Lite Game on PC, was developed by a <strong>Team of 6 members</strong> in the context of a class in 2022. I was responsible for development of the enemies. This included <strong>designing and modelling</strong> of the cyberpunk inspired rats, as well as <strong>developing the Enemy-AI</strong> using Behaviour Trees. The game was developed in <strong>Unity 3D and C#</strong>.</p>

													<h3><strong>A Nightmare on Bahnhofsstreet</strong></h3>
													<p>A Nightmare on Bahnhofsstreet is a Virtual Reality Game made in UE4. We were a <strong>Team of 6 students</strong> and had 3 months to build this game. I was mainly responsible for <strong>modelling objects</strong> for our scenes, such as collectables, static objects and interactable objects. Furthermore I had a small introduction to <strong>Visual Scripting in UE4</strong>.</p>

													<h3><strong>Not Pong</strong></h3>
													<p>This 2D Puzzle Game was inspired by the mechanics of Angry Birds and was used to <strong>learn the ropes</strong> of development in Unity. The idea of a beer pong game came during my first semester, and the result was this game. I drew all the art and followed various tutorials for the logic.</p>
